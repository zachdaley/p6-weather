## Due
* P6: Weather due Sun. 2/16 at Midnight

## Project Definition & Goals
Weather information is ubiquitous but how that information is presented varies greatly. Websites provided non-essential content, ads, and unrelated information. The limited screen size has created a [Mobile First Design](http://zurb.com/word/mobile-first) process. Designers are forced to focus on the content first. The goals are: 

1. Understand and apply Mobile First Design process. Reference [Zurb's Mobile First Design](http://zurb.com/word/mobile-first) and [Brad Frost's Mobile First Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/web/mobile-first-responsive-web-design/)

2. Extend the [Simple Weather](http://www.unheap.com/other/standalone-widgets/simpleweather/) jQuery plugin and [Zurb Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

3. Use icon fonts. Icon font's are a relatively new way to add icons to sites and apps without image files. Great for Mobile First Design.

## Poor Examples

* [Weather.com](http://www.b.weather.com/?pin=true)
* [Yahoo Weather](http://weather.yahoo.com/)
* [Accuweather](http://www.accuweather.com/en/us/cheney-wa/99004/weather-forecast/336377)
* [Locally - KREM](http://www.krem.com/weather)

## Good Examples

Google has started a trend of providing only the necessary content. Search for “weather” and only the forecast will be listed. Content first is a not a new concept in graphic design. Your design challenge to reinterpret (redesign) the display weather information (content). How can we change the interaction? How can the visuals be improved, e.g. icons, or graphic? Why is it presented so differently on many sites?
